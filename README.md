## Overview

This project is a web application built using Django for the backend and React for the frontend. It provides a portfolio management system where users can log in and manage their stock portfolios. The application uses Webpack for module bundling and includes a service worker for offline capabilities.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. **Set up the backend (Django):**

   - Navigate to the backend directory.
   - Create a virtual environment and activate it.
   - Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the frontend (React):**

   - Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run database migrations:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the development servers:**

   - Start the Django server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   - In another terminal, start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- Access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
- Use the login route (`/login`) to authenticate and access the portfolio management features.
- If you encounter a page that doesn't exist, you'll be redirected to a "Not Found" page.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into two main directories:

1. **Backend (Django):**
   - **`settings.py`**: Contains all the configurations for the Django application.
   - **`urls.py`**: Manages the URL routing for the application.
   - **`views.py`**: Contains the logic for handling requests and responses.

2. **Frontend (React):**
   - **`src/index.js`**: Entry point for the React application.
   - **`src/App.js`**: Main application component that manages routing.
   - **`src/components/`**: Contains various React components like `Home`, `Portfolio`, `Login`, and `NotFound`.

3. **Webpack Configuration**: Handles the bundling of JavaScript files and assets.
