Quick change

## Overview

This project is a web application built with Django and React, utilizing Webpack for module bundling. It provides a development environment with features such as hot reloading and proxying API requests. The application includes user authentication and a portfolio section.

## Major Parts of the Code

1. **Django Backend**:
   - The backend is set up using Django, with configurations located in `backend/settings.py`.
   - The application uses `django-webpack-loader` to serve bundled assets generated by Webpack.
   - The database is configured to use SQLite for development purposes.
   - URL routing is managed in `backend/urls.py`, including routes for the admin interface and the main application.

2. **React Frontend**:
   - The frontend is built using React, with routing managed by `react-router-dom`.
   - Components such as `Home`, `Login`, `Portfolio`, and `NotFound` are defined in the `components` directory.
   - The main application entry point is in `src/index.js`, where the main `App` component is rendered.

3. **Webpack Configuration**:
   - Webpack is configured to handle JavaScript, CSS, and other assets, with configurations found in the `config` directory.
   - Development and production configurations are defined to optimize the build process and support features like code splitting and asset optimization.

4. **Proxy Setup**:
   - The application is set up to proxy API requests to a Django server running on `localhost:8000`.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)**:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Install Node.js Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the backend folder and add your configurations. For example:
   ```
   DJANGO_SECRET_KEY='your_secret_key'
   DEBUG=True
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Backend

1. **Migrate the Database**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Run the Django Development Server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Running the Frontend
