# Project Overview

This project is a web application built using React for the frontend and Django for the backend. It utilizes Webpack for module bundling and includes a proxy setup to facilitate API calls to the Django server. The application features routing, state management, and a responsive design.

## Major Parts of the Code

### Frontend (React)

- **Components**: The application consists of several React components such as `Home`, `Login`, `Portfolio`, and `NotFound`, which handle different routes and user interactions.
  
- **Routing**: The app uses `react-router-dom` to manage navigation between different components based on the URL.

- **App Structure**: The main `App` component sets up the routing using `BrowserRouter` and `Switch`.

- **Service Worker**: The application includes a service worker for offline capabilities.

- **Styles**: CSS is used for styling the components, with support for CSS modules and SASS.

### Backend (Django)

- **Django Settings**: The Django backend is configured with settings that include database configurations, middleware, installed apps, and static file handling.

- **APIs**: The backend is set up to serve API requests, which can be proxied from the React frontend.

- **Static File Handling**: The application uses `whitenoise` to serve static files efficiently in production.

### Build and Development

- **Webpack**: The project uses Webpack for module bundling and development server setup. It includes configurations for handling various file types (JS, CSS, images, etc.) and optimizations for production builds.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory and install the required packages.
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required packages.
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and configure your environment variables as needed.

5. **Run Migrations**:
   - Apply database migrations for Django.
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Start the Django Backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. **Start the React Frontend**:
   - Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory.
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the React application.

4. **Using the Application**:
   - Use the navigation links to explore different components such as Home, Login, and Portfolio. The application will route you accordingly.
